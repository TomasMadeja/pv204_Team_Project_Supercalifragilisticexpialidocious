/**
 * A participant in a Password Authenticated Key Exchange by Juggling (J-PAKE) exchange.
 * <p>
 * The J-PAKE exchange is defined by Feng Hao and Peter Ryan in the paper
 * <a href="http://grouper.ieee.org/groups/1363/Research/contributions/hao-ryan-2008.pdf">
 * "Password Authenticated Key Exchange by Juggling, 2008."</a>
 * <p>
 * The J-PAKE protocol is symmetric.
 * There is no notion of a <i>client</i> or <i>server</i>, but rather just two <i>participants</i>.
 * An instance of {@link JPAKEParticipant} represents one participant, and
 * is the primary interface for executing the exchange.
 * <p>
 * To execute an exchange, construct a {@link JPAKEParticipant} on each end,
 * and call the following 7 methods
 * (once and only once, in the given order, for each participant, sending messages between them as described):
 * <ol>
 * <li>{@link #createRound1PayloadToSend()} - and send the payload to the other participant</li>
 * <li>{@link #validateRound1PayloadReceived(JPAKERound1Payload)} - use the payload received from the other participant</li>
 * <li>{@link #createRound2PayloadToSend()} - and send the payload to the other participant</li>
 * <li>{@link #validateRound2PayloadReceived(JPAKERound2Payload)} - use the payload received from the other participant</li>
 * <li>{@link #calculateKeyingMaterial()}</li>
 * <li>{@link #createRound3PayloadToSend(BigInteger)} - and send the payload to the other participant</li>
 * <li>{@link #validateRound3PayloadReceived(JPAKERound3Payload, BigInteger)} - use the payload received from the other participant</li>
 * </ol>
 * <p>
 * Each side should derive a session key from the keying material returned by {@link #calculateKeyingMaterial()}.
 * The caller is responsible for deriving the session key using a secure key derivation function (KDF).
 * <p>
 * Round 3 is an optional key confirmation process.
 * If you do not execute round 3, then there is no assurance that both participants are using the same key.
 * (i.e. if the participants used different passwords, then their session keys will differ.)
 * <p>
 * If the round 3 validation succeeds, then the keys are guaranteed to be the same on both sides.
 * <p>
 * The symmetric design can easily support the asymmetric cases when one party initiates the communication.
 * e.g. Sometimes the round1 payload and round2 payload may be sent in one pass.
 * Also, in some cases, the key confirmation payload can be sent together with the round2 payload.
 * These are the trivial techniques to optimize the communication.
 * <p>
 * The key confirmation process is implemented as specified in
 * <a href="http://csrc.nist.gov/publications/nistpubs/800-56A/SP800-56A_Revision1_Mar08-2007.pdf">NIST SP 800-56A Revision 1</a>,
 * Section 8.2 Unilateral Key Confirmation for Key Agreement Schemes.
 * <p>
 * This class is stateful and NOT threadsafe.
 * Each instance should only be used for ONE complete J-PAKE exchange
 * (i.e. a new {@link JPAKEParticipant} should be constructed for each new J-PAKE exchange).
 * <p>
